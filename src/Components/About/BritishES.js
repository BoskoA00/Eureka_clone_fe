            The British Education System In the UK, students usually start at
            the age of 5 and enter the first year of school. Primary school is
            made up of 6 years. Students then follow on to secondary school,
            which they end with their GCSE exams.
            <br /> Each subject is assessed separately by a series of exams
            leading to GCSEs or international GCSEs. Students can then choose to
            go on to college, where they choose 3 subjects (sometimes 4), which
            are also assessed seperately and form the basis of entry to
            university and other courses.
            <br />
            Colleges often also offer other qualifications, leading to students
            gaining employment and apprenticeships.
