                run for the duration of the UK school year (see term dates for
                more information). Enrolment is normally only accepted for the
                entire school year, or remaining school yearand only confirmed
                after payment has been made. Late or partial enrolment is
                accepted at the schools discretion and discounts may be offered
                to account for time missed. However due to students gaining
                access to recordings for past lessons, any discounts are given
                at the discretion of the school. To enrol, an enrolmentform has
                to be filled out. Upon acceptance, payment will have to be made
                to confirm enrolment. Shortly before the coursestart date,
                students will receive all the informationthey need (logins
                etc.).Private lessons can be booked on the website or by
                contacting the school at any time and there is no formal
                application process. Any timeslots available can be booked on a
                first come first served bases. Similarly, fixed term courses can
                be booked on the website up until 24 hours before the first
                lesson or anytime by contacting the school. Further information
                is available on the website relating to each specific
                course.Fixed term courses normally run for a specific time e.g.
                3 months. After that time, you will have to sign up again for
                the next term if you wish to continue.Section C -CANCELLATION
                POLICYOur cancellation policy varies by type of course or class.
                Homeschoolingclasses can be cancelled up to14 days have gone by

                your notice, however any deposits for holding

              <p>
                your place may be retained. You are required to delete any files
                provided by the school and not retain any course materials. Once
                the initial “cooling off period” has passed, cancellation is
                possible depending on chosen contract. On annual contracts,
                cancellation is possible to the end of each term, as long as 4
                weeks’ notice is given before the end of that term. The relevant
                deadline is Friday 5pm. On monthly contracts, cancellation is
                possible at any time,as long as 4 weeks’ notice is given.For
                enrolments that are wholly completed on-line or via telephone
                the distance selling regulations apply. The schoolcomplies in
                full with the 2 Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation
                and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 and will provide a full
                refund of any fees paid if a notification of cancellation is
                received from the student within fourteen days of purchasing a
                course. Cancellation of a payment plan, recurring payments is
                not cancellation of your liability to pay fees -you will be
                expected to pay fees in full. In cases of hardship students are
                advised to contact the school.Failure to pay fees /
                non-intention to pay fees is a breach of our terms of sale
                contract and will result in legal action by our solicitors.We
                also reserve the rights to block access to the class until you
                have caught up with your payments.Private lessons can be
                cancelled up until 24 hours before the scheduled class time. If
                this time has passed, the class can no longer be cancelled,
                however can be rescheduled up to 6 hours in advanceat the
                discretion of the teacher.Once both of these times have passed,
                it is no longer possible to reschedule or cancel. A class that
                was rescheduled less than 24 hours before the original class
                time cannot be cancelled later. This is to prevent
                studentsrescheduling a class last minute to a date in the future
                and then cancel, to circumvent the cancellation policy.Fixed
                term courses can be cancelled up until 24 hours before the first
                lessons of the course. After that,the class cannot be
                cancelledby you. If you join for the first time you normally get
                one free lesson as atrial. If you sign up after this, you can
                cancel up until 24 hours before your first payable class.
                Packages, gift certificates and subscriptions bought, such as
                private lesson packages, can be cancelled for a refund within 2
                weeks of purchase. Any aspect of the package used (e.g. classes
                used) are deducted from the refund.Section D -PAYMENTSPayments
                are accepted via card throughs stripe, PayPal, bank transferor
                direct debit via GoCardless. Payments have to be made at the
                time of purchase through any of these methodsand before the
                start of any courses. Any monthly payment options are credit
                terms and cannot be cancelled. We do not normally offer pay as
                you go for classes and courses. You have to commit to the full
                term. Private lessons you can book and pay at your own
                convenience.Section E -TEACHER ABSENCE AND ILLNESSAs with any
                school,teachers can be ill or absent for any other reason. In
                the case of absence students will be informedvia our “Moodle”
                platformor by email. Private lessons will normally be
                rescheduled in agreement with you, and you do have the right to
                ask for a refund. Wherever possible you will be informed at
                least 24 hours in advance. Should a teacher miss fixed term
                classes, there will either be another teacher to cover,or most
                commonly the missed lesson is rescheduled to the end of the term
                (or any other day in agreement with all students). The school
                reserves the right to change the teacher during the course,
                should a teacher become unavailable. Homeschool classes arenot
                normally rescheduled, unless more than 3 lessons are missed in
                succession. Wherever possible cover is organised for the lesson
                by one of our other teachers.

                Students will be notified via the platform to enter the relevant
                teacher’sclassroom instead. Should cover not be available at
                short notice, the teacher will leave a recording or provide work
                tobe completed during the lesson time and submitted for feedback
                thereafter. Should the teacher be absent last minute, this
                recording may be provided at a later date than the scheduled
                lesson time.Section F -LIVE LESSONS AND RECORDINGSLive lessons

                and certain other conditions can cause students to feel

                agreement allow the student to watch the lesson without
                participation. We will encourage participation and expect

                instructions and not be disruptive. Teachers at their own
                discretion have the right to mute or remove any students that

                instructions.Lessons are recorded for all homeschool classes,
                however not normally for fixed term courses and private lessons.

                responsible for the arrangement ofanyexaminations, mainly
                applicable to our homeschool classes.In the course of teaching
                practical subjects,teachers may ask children to make art and
                design objects and scientific experiments involving potentially
                hazardous tools and materials. Parents/guardians must supervise
                their children online and offline and are responsible for the
                safety of their children online and offline. Our teachers are
                DBS checked and qualified in their subjects. In an attempt to
                prevent unwanted communication between adults (other
                parents/staff) and children,only email addresses of adults
                andtheirtelephone numbers are on our system unless they are
                provided by you with written permission to contact the student
                directly instead of you. You are responsible for monitoring
                yourchildren’s messages.Children's email addresses/telephone
                numbers are only used for the purpose of account logins,

                staff absence or substitute teachers and more is sent to the
                students via our monitored platform messaging services. By using
                our platform,you agree to teachers sending messages to your
                children. Despite us monitoring messages, itdoes not guarantee
                safety online. Parents must monitor communications involving
                their children to keep them safe.Parent accounts on platforms
                have access to their children’s communications. Despite out best
                efforts we cannot guarantee that students exchange contact
                details with their peers and are contacted through these by
                other adults and children. Wemonitor all messages as far as
                possible and remove and block any adult contacting minors
                without consent by their parents as well as anyone sending
                offensive messages. We have a zero-tolerance policy with regards
                to adults contacting students and unsocialbehaviour. In the case
                of bullying by another student, a warning will be sent to
                parents with immediate expulsion upon reoffending.It is assumed
                that students enrol on to a course because they feel they can
                complete it. Typically,students have studied the subject at a
                lower level before embarking on a course. Teachers reserve the
                right to move students who are not ready/capable of studying a
                course to a more appropriate lower level if necessary,in their
                professional opinion. The schoolhas the aim of helping students
                progressand studying at the wrong level is not advantageous to
                this.It cannot onlybedamaging to a student's self-esteem and
                hence may harm their educational prospectsbut also leave them
                further behind.Students on our courses accept this condition and
                will not receive a refund should this happen to them.The student
                and parents will be contacted in such case and their option
                discussed. Students can remain in the class if they can proof
                that they have taken the steps to catch up in a timely fashion.
                Itisup to the teacher and the school to make the final decision,
                based on their professional opinion related to the student and
                the impact on the students’self-esteemas well as the other
                students in the class. In no case shall the school, our
